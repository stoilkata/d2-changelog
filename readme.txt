cube recipes:
El to Ort runes - 3x rune = next rune
Thul to Cham - 2x rune = next rune


cham + uniq melee weapon = adds ethereal mod
zod + uniq melee weapon = adds indestructible mod
!!! FIRST MAKE IT ETHEREAL, THEN MAKE IT INDESTRUCTIBLE! INDESTRUCTIBLE ITEMS CANNOT BECOME ETHEREAL! MAKE SURE YOU DO THE CHAM + ITEM FIRST!!!

Charm + 2 flawless = reroll

Sets:
Natalya, Aldur, Immortal King, Griswold and Mavina's weapons removed from the set. These weapons can still drop.
